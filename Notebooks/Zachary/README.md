# Lab Notebook

## Entry for September 11, 2024

### Objective
- Met with my team for the first time to review the project: a water-skimming robot designed to detect and collect pollutants from water surfaces.
- Focused on exploring possible designs for the robot and researching water turbidity as a key metric for determining water cleanliness.

### What Was Done
1. Discussed the core goals of our project:
   - The robot should autonomously navigate water surfaces, detect pollutants using turbidity sensors, and collect debris for disposal or analysis.
2. Researched existing water-skimming robots for design inspiration.
   - Found the [Jellyfishbot](https://www.iadys.com/jellyfishbot/), which provided useful insights into possible physical designs and collection mechanisms.
3. Began investigating water turbidity as an indicator of pollution:
   - Discovered that turbidity measures how particles suspended in water scatter light, making it a reliable way to assess water quality.

4. Collaborated with the team on drafting our project approval, due tomorrow (September 12). We focused on clearly presenting the problem, our solution, and the technical approach.
